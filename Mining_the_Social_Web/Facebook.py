## Example 1. Making Graph API requests over HTTP

import requests # pip install requests
import json

base_url = 'https://graph.facebook.com/me'

# Get 10 likes for 10 friends
fields = 'id,name,friends.limit(10).fields(likes.limit(10))'

ACCESS_TOKEN = 'EAACEdEose0cBAPPtmfRD1HGtxPIv6ChTspHD98fL8oBufiUogVCK5fOryzmxG5E3mhOEES0CLL08hbp7feeiQNLgMWw1WbyaZBYZADEijtVtSC5SZABrEsX45t4dOlzSqN6xv4y0GZA0A7UsnsZBpPgKsSIzy8THcf2s786vjLwZDZD'

url = '%s?fields=%s&access_token=%s' % \
    (base_url, fields, ACCESS_TOKEN,)

# This API is HTTP-based and could be requested in the browser,
# with a command line utlity like curl, or using just about
# any programming language by making a request to the URL.
# Click the hyperlink that appears in your notebook output
# when you execute this code cell to see for yourself...
# print url

# Interpret the response as JSON and convert back
# to Python data structures
content = requests.get(url).json()

# Pretty-print the JSON and display it
# print json.dumps(content, indent=1)

## Example 2. Querying the Graph API with Python

import facebook # pip install facebook-sdk
import json

# A helper function to pretty-print Python objects as JSON

def pp(o): 
    print json.dumps(o, indent=1)

# Create a connection to the Graph API with your access token

g = facebook.GraphAPI(ACCESS_TOKEN)

# Execute a few sample queries

# print '---------------'
# print 'Me'
# print '---------------'
# pp(g.get_object('me'))
# print
# print '---------------'
# print 'My Friends'
# print '---------------'
# pp(g.get_connections('me', 'friends'))
# print
# print '---------------'
# print 'Social Web'
# print '---------------'
# pp(g.request("search", {'q' : 'social web', 'type' : 'page'}))

## Example 3. Results for a Graph API query for Mining the Social Web

# Get an instance of Mining the Social Web
# Using the page name also works if you know it.
# e.g. 'MiningTheSocialWeb' or 'CrossFit'
mtsw_id = '146803958708175'
# pp(g.get_object(mtsw_id))

## Example 4. Querying the Graph API for Open Graph objects by their URLs

# MTSW catalog lin
# pp(g.get_object('http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030195.do'))

# PCI catalog link
# pp(g.get_object('http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529321.do'))

##ã€€Example 5. Comparing likes between Coke and Pepsi fan pages

# Find Pepsi and Coke in search results

pp(g.request('search', {'q' : 'pepsi', 'type' : 'page', 'limit' : 5}))
pp(g.request('search', {'q' : 'coke', 'type' : 'page', 'limit' : 5}))

# Use the ids to query for likes

pepsi_id = '56381779049' # Could also use 'PepsiUS'
coke_id = '40796308305'  # Could also use 'CocaCola'

# A quick way to format integers with commas every 3 digits
def int_format(n): return "{:,}".format(n)

print "Pepsi likes:", int_format(g.get_object(pepsi_id)['likes'])
print "Coke likes:", int_format(g.get_object(coke_id)['likes'])

## Example 6. Querying a page for its "feed" and "links" connections

pp(g.get_connections(pepsi_id, 'feed'))
pp(g.get_connections(pepsi_id, 'links'))

pp(g.get_connections(coke_id, 'feed'))
pp(g.get_connections(coke_id, 'links'))

## Example 7. Querying for all of your friends' likes

# First, let's query for all of the likes in your social
# network and store them in a slightly more convenient
# data structure as a dictionary keyed on each friend's
# name. We'll use a dictionary comprehension to iterate
# over the friends and build up the likes in an intuitive
# way, although the new "field expansion" feature could 
# technically do the job in one fell swoop as follows:
#
# g.get_object('me', fields='id,name,friends.fields(id,name,likes)')
#
# See Appendix C for more information on Python tips such as
# dictionary comprehensions

# Only friends who installed this app are returned in API v2.0 and higher. 
# total_count in summary represents the total number of friends, including 
# those who haven't installed the app.

friends = g.get_connections("me", "friends")['data']

likes = { friend['name'] : g.get_connections(friend['id'], "likes")['data'] 
          for friend in friends }

print likes

## Example 8. Calculating the most popular likes among your friends

# Analyze all likes from friendships for frequency

# pip install prettytable
from prettytable import PrettyTable
from collections import Counter

friends_likes = Counter([like['name']
                         for friend in likes 
                           for like in likes[friend]
                               if like.get('name')])

pt = PrettyTable(field_names=['Name', 'Freq'])
pt.align['Name'], pt.align['Freq'] = 'l', 'r'
[ pt.add_row(fl) for fl in friends_likes.most_common(10) ]

print 'Top 10 likes amongst friends'
print pt

## Example 9. Calculating the most popular categories for likes among your friends

# Analyze all like categories by frequency

friends_likes_categories = Counter([like['category'] 
                                    for friend in likes 
                                      for like in likes[friend]])

pt = PrettyTable(field_names=['Category', 'Freq'])
pt.align['Category'], pt.align['Freq'] = 'l', 'r'
[ pt.add_row(flc) for flc in friends_likes_categories.most_common(10) ]

print "Top 10 like categories for friends"
print pt

## Example 10. Calculating the number of likes for each friend and sorting by frequency

# Build a frequency distribution of number of likes by 
# friend with a dictionary comprehension and sort it in 
# descending order

from operator import itemgetter

num_likes_by_friend = { friend : len(likes[friend]) 
                        for friend in likes }


pt = PrettyTable(field_names=['Friend', 'Num Likes'])
pt.align['Friend'], pt.align['Num Likes'] = 'l', 'r'
[ pt.add_row(nlbf) 
  for nlbf in sorted(num_likes_by_friend.items(), 
                     key=itemgetter(1), 
                     reverse=True) ]

print "Number of likes per friend"
print pt

## Example 11. Finding common likes between an ego and its friendships in a social network

# Which of your likes are in common with which friends?
my_likes = [ like['name'] 
             for like in g.get_connections("me", "likes")['data'] ]

pt = PrettyTable(field_names=["Name"])
pt.align = 'l'
[ pt.add_row((ml,)) for ml in my_likes ]
print "My likes"
print pt

# Use the set intersection as represented by the ampersand
# operator to find common likes.

common_likes = list(set(my_likes) & set(friends_likes))

pt = PrettyTable(field_names=["Name"])
pt.align = 'l'
[ pt.add_row((cl,)) for cl in common_likes ]
print
print "My common likes with friends"
print pt

## Example 12. Calculating the friends most similar to an ego in a social network

# Which of your friends like things that you like?

similar_friends = [ (friend, friend_like['name']) 
                     for friend, friend_likes in likes.items()
                       for friend_like in friend_likes
                         if friend_like.get('name') in common_likes ]


# Filter out any possible duplicates that could occur

ranked_friends = Counter([ friend for (friend, like) in list(set(similar_friends)) ])


pt = PrettyTable(field_names=["Friend", "Common Likes"])
pt.align["Friend"], pt.align["Common Likes"] = 'l', 'r'
[ pt.add_row(rf) 
  for rf in sorted(ranked_friends.items(), 
                   key=itemgetter(1), 
                   reverse=True) ]
print "My similar friends (ranked)"
print pt

# Also keep in mind that you have the full range of plotting
# capabilities available to you. A quick histogram that shows
# how many friends.

plt.hist(ranked_friends.values())
plt.xlabel('Bins (number of friends with shared likes)')
plt.ylabel('Number of shared likes in each bin')

# Keep in mind that you can customize the binning
# as desired. See http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html

# For example...

plt.figure() # Display the previous plot
plt.hist(ranked_friends.values(),
          bins=arange(1,max(ranked_friends.values()),1))
plt.xlabel('Bins (number of friends with shared likes)')
plt.ylabel('Number of shared likes in each bin')
plt.figure() # Display the working plot

## Example 13. Constructing a graph of mutual friendships

import networkx as nx # pip install networkx
import requests # pip install requests

friends = [ (friend['id'], friend['name'],)
                for friend in g.get_connections('me', 'friends')['data'] ]

url = 'https://graph.facebook.com/me/mutualfriends/%s?access_token=%s'

mutual_friends = {} 

# This loop spawns a separate request for each iteration, so
# it may take a while. Optimization with a thread pool or similar
# technique would be possible.
for friend_id, friend_name in friends:
    r = requests.get(url % (friend_id, ACCESS_TOKEN,) )
    response_data = json.loads(r.content)['data']
    mutual_friends[friend_name] = [ data['name'] 
                                    for data in response_data ]
    
nxg = nx.Graph()

[ nxg.add_edge('me', mf) for mf in mutual_friends ]

[ nxg.add_edge(f1, f2) 
  for f1 in mutual_friends 
      for f2 in mutual_friends[f1] ]

# Explore what's possible to do with the graph by 
# typing nxg.<tab> or executing a new cell with 
# the following value in it to see some pydoc on nxg
print nxg

## Example 14. Finding and analyzing cliques in a graph of mutual friendships

# Finding cliques is a hard problem, so this could
# take a while for large graphs.
# See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete and 
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_problem.

cliques = [c for c in nx.find_cliques(nxg)]

num_cliques = len(cliques)

clique_sizes = [len(c) for c in cliques]
max_clique_size = max(clique_sizes)
avg_clique_size = sum(clique_sizes) / num_cliques

max_cliques = [c for c in cliques if len(c) == max_clique_size]

num_max_cliques = len(max_cliques)

max_clique_sets = [set(c) for c in max_cliques]
friends_in_all_max_cliques = list(reduce(lambda x, y: x.intersection(y),
                                  max_clique_sets))

print 'Num cliques:', num_cliques
print 'Avg clique size:', avg_clique_size
print 'Max clique size:', max_clique_size
print 'Num max cliques:', num_max_cliques
print
print 'Friends in all max cliques:'
print json.dumps(friends_in_all_max_cliques, indent=1)
print
print 'Max cliques:'
print json.dumps(max_cliques, indent=1)
